# Project 2: Machine-Learning-Algorithm-for-Music-Meter-Identification

This project focuses on identifying tempo and meter in audio tracks using machine learning. It was completed as part of my academic project to explore audio analysis and feature extraction in music datasets.  

* Dataset was taken from kaggle (audio data).
* Machine Learning Model used: Decision Tree Regressor.
* LIBROSA library was used for audio feature extraction.
* Model was deployed using TENSORFLOW.
